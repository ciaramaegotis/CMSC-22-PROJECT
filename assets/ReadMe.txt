If you are going to include it in your code, you should use the path. which ./assets/<imageORsoundfile>

NOTE:
1.) the image LawnLevel1 and LawnLevel2 are not the same. The LawnLevel1 has picture of a plant above, 
wherein LawnLevel2 only has the picture of the main lawn. It is because the picture is still yet to be editted.
Yes, ieedit pa yung picture, ic-crop pa natin yung picture. aalisin yung halaman sa taas sa lawnlevel1.
gagawa tayo ng version natin.
